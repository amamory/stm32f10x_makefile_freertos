# STM32 Makefile FreeRTOS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/freelamb/stm32f10x_makefile_freertos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/freelamb/stm32f10x_makefile_freertos)

## Requirement

Working GNU ARM GCC (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)

Texane stlink to flash the STM32F10x (https://github.com/texane/stlink)

FreeRTOS Source (http://www.freertos.org)

## Usage

### build project

```
$ make
```

### clean project

```
$ make clean
```

### download to mcu by stlink
```
$ make flash
```

### erase flash
```
$ make erase
```

### download main.bin to mcu
```
$ ./build.sh
```

## Debug base on st-link

start debug
```
$ st-util
```

open shell in project root dir
```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb *.elf

## TODO Amory - my own reminder to my future self

I used this project to implement mesh network using RadioHead library using Blue Pill (STM32F10x). However, I have to adapt the low level part of the software. Luckly, there is something similar to STM32F4xx in the dir RadioHead-1.97/STM32ArduinoCompat. Look at makefile_radiohead.mk, ./STM32ArduinoCompat/wirish.cpp, and ./STM32ArduinoCompat/Hardwareserial.cpp to see what i have done so far. grep for 'TODO Amory' to check the changes so far.
